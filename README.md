# TheTherapyGame

A serious game platform developed using Unity 3D game Engine and Kinect V2 sensor as a natural user interface. The aim of this work was to provide a tool for objective evaluation of patients’ movements during physiotherapy sessions as well as a pleasant way that may increase patient engagement on training motor rehabilitation exercises.

The developed platform based on Kinect V2 sensor detects 3D motion of different body joints and provides data storage capability in a remote database. The platform for patient’s data management during physiotherapy process includes biometric data, some data relevant for physiotherapist related to patient’s clinical history, obtained scores during serious game based training and values of metrics such as the distance between feet during a game, left and right feet usage frequency and execution time for imposed movement associated with game mechanics.

The player of this game is represented by a “stretched cube” (3)(parallelepiped) where the patient takes control of it by leaning to the side he wants the player to move. With this, the main objective is to collect objects that give points and avoid the ones that take, to reach the established score upon customization. There are other types of objects within the game that impose challenge or help the patient during gameplay.

5.Infinite Runner

Referring to the upper body members, the game was manly made for the patient to gain flexibility and dexterity on the upper members by collecting the objects in the scene with his hands.
On start, the avatar controlled by the patient will move forward in the map at a certain speed defined by the therapist. The patient will have completely control of the avatar from the waist up. While moving forward the patient will have to avoid the bombs (1) objects placed on the game ground, meant to take points, and try to hit the medic Packs (2) in order to gain lives (3), to do that he will have to control the avatar by leaning to the desired side and stand straight to make the avatar move straight.The player also must be aware of poison objects (5) that take lives and spawns on the same areas as the diamonds.

6.Hit Wall

This game focused also on the upper limbs. It, having a set of different game scenes which correspond to four different levels for each hand, levels which were created manually. A different approach was taken where it only exists one scene, and the different maps/levels are loaded on game start from a xml file.

In this game we wanted to turn the game even more flexible, than just have premade levels, so in customization game window, before starting a new game, there is a possibility for the therapist to create his own map, leading to an editing window.
